Team U’s Duck Hunt is a three-dimensional reimagination of Nintendo’s 1984 game for the
NES with the same name. While Team U’s Duck Hunt doesn’t keep all of the mechanics that
make Duck Hunt a game, it captures a lot of the essence of what that game is: there is a
duck that flies around the screen, and the player has an in-game gun (representing
Nintendo’s Zapper gun controller) that they can use in order to shoot the duck. The
object of the game is to do exactly that.

More specifically, Team U’s version Duck Hunt has a single duck that flies in a circle
in front of the player on the screen. The goal of the player is to shoot this duck,
although the duck won’t die unless duck death is enabled (by pressing [X]). If duck death
is enabled, shooting the duck will cause it to die in a similar manner to the NES Duck
Hunt (it freezes for a moment, and then falls to the ground and despawns). The player
then wins, or they can continue playing by respawning the duck with the [N] key.

Team U’s Duck Hunt is made using both C++ and OpenGL, with models created in Maya.

Navigate to the Duck Hunt/Bin folder and double-click the Assignment1-Release.exe file
- Alternatively, navigate to the Duck Hunt/VS2017 folder and run the .sln file to see
  the source code and solution. You may have to retarget the solution for it to run.

There are no required external libraries.
