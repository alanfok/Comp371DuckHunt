Team U’s Duck Hunt is a three-dimensional reimagination of Nintendo’s 1984 game for the NES with the same name. While Team U’s Duck Hunt doesn’t keep all of the mechanics that make Duck Hunt a game, it captures a lot of the essence of what that game is: there is a duck that flies around the screen, and the player has an in-game gun (representing Nintendo’s Zapper gun controller) that they can use in order to shoot the duck. The object of the game is to do exactly that.

More specifically, Team U’s version Duck Hunt has a single duck that flies in a circle in front of the player on the screen. The goal of the player is to shoot this duck, although the duck won’t die unless duck death is enabled (by pressing [X]). If duck death is enabled, shooting the duck will cause it to die in a similar manner to the NES Duck Hunt (it freezes for a moment, and then falls to the ground and despawns). The player then wins, or they can continue playing by respawning the duck with the [N] key.

Team U’s Duck Hunt is made using both C++ and OpenGL, with models created in Maya.
